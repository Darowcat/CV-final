If you want to run "train_v1.py", please:
  1. Change the data path in config.py (if your path isn't './ForTrain...')
  2. Run script.sh as follows (if one GPU is accessible)
     > CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 sh script.sh
  3. Fill "TODO" block for loss and save_pth
  - [ ] Arcface loss
  - [x] save path
  - [ ] rank 1 evaluation
  - [x] AUC evaluation
  - [ ] Data augmentation
